# Important third part (design) notes:

Successful Login for the design part is "123" for both phone number and password inputs.
The rest -> incorrect.
After 3 failed tries -> you'll get to a failed state.

Note: The background video may appear distorted on mobile browsers. For the best experience,
I recommend viewing it using a desktop browser or the inspect tool on a computer.

Enjoy!

### Run the development server

The codebase uses a development server to run the code. This is a server that
runs on your local machine, and allows you to view the code in your browser. To
run the development server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## View the application in your browser

Once the server is running, you can view the application in your browser. To do
this, open Chrome (or Chromium), and type the following into the address bar:

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```
